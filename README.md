# Welcome to Strat Roulette!

This **definitely** isn't the first Strat Roulette website, it's probably not even the first one on github, but here it is, a revolutionary game, coming to a Competitive CS:GO match near you, the all new **STRAT ROULETTE!â„¢** 

There's a load of in game prompts that you can roll for, some exclusive to CT, some to T, you can switch between depending on your side by clicking on the CT/T icon, you can tell which side you're on based on the background colour of the website (blue for CT, brown/yellow for T)

Hope you guys enjoy, have fun and lemme know what you think! If you have any suggestions there's a link on the site to send them my way and I'll implement them when I remember to check the suggestion box!
